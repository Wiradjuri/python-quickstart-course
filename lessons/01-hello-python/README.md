# Lesson 1: Hello Python & Basic Syntax 👋

**Time: 10 minutes | Difficulty: Beginner**

Welcome to your Python journey! In this lesson, you'll write your first Python program and learn the basic syntax.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- How to run Python code
- Print statements and comments
- Basic Python syntax rules
- Your first interactive program

## 🚀 Let's Start Coding!

### Step 1: Your First Python Program

Create a new file called `hello.py` and type this:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
print("Welcome to Python!")
```

**Run it:** Open your terminal/command prompt, navigate to this folder, and type:
```bash
python hello.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Hello, World!
Welcome to Python!
```

🎉 **Congratulations!** You just wrote and ran your first Python program!

### Step 2: Understanding the Code

- `print()` is a **function** that displays text on the screen
- Text goes inside quotes: `"Hello, World!"`
- Each line is a **statement** that Python executes

### Step 3: Comments (Notes for Humans)

```python
# This is a comment - Python ignores this line
print("This line runs")  # Comment at the end of a line

# Comments help explain what your code does
# Use them to leave notes for yourself and others
```

### Step 4: Making It Interactive

Let's make your program ask for the user's name:

```python
# Ask the user for their name
name = input("What's your name? ")

# Greet them personally
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
print("Nice to meet you!")
```

**Try it out!** Run this code and type your name when prompted.

### Step 5: Python Syntax Rules (The Basics)

1. **Case Sensitive**: `Print` ≠ `print` (use lowercase)
2. **Indentation Matters**: We'll learn this in Lesson 3
3. **Quotes for Text**: Use `"text"` or `'text'`
4. **Parentheses for Functions**: `print()`, `input()`

## 💡 Quick Tips

- **Stuck?** Check for typos in your code
- **Error messages** are helpful - read them!
- **Experiment** - try changing the text and see what happens

## 🏋️ Practice Exercise

Create a program that:
1. Asks for the user's favorite color
2. Asks for their favorite animal
3. Prints a fun message combining both

**Example Output:**
```
What's your favorite color? blue
What's your favorite animal? elephant
Wow! A blue elephant would be amazing!
```

**Solution:** Check `exercise_solution.py` if you get stuck.
