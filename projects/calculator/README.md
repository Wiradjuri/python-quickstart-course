# Project 1: Interactive Calculator 🧮

**Build a fully functional calculator that can perform multiple operations!**

## 🎯 What You'll Build

A command-line calculator that:
- Performs basic math operations (+, -, *, /)
- Handles multiple calculations in one session
- Includes error handling for invalid input
- Has a clean, user-friendly interface

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Basic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division  
✅ **Continuous Mode**: Keep calculating without restarting  
✅ **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles invalid input  
✅ **Clean Interface**: Easy to use and understand  

## 📁 Project Files

- `calculator.py` - Main calculator program
- `simple_calculator.py` - Basic version to start with
- `README.md` - This file

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run

```bash
python calculator.py
```

## 🎮 Example Usage

```
=== Python Calculator ===
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Choose operation (+, -, *, /): +
Result: 10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0

Continue? (y/n): y
Enter first number: 20
Enter second number: 4
Choose operation (+, -, *, /): /
Result: 20.0 / 4.0 = 5.0

Continue? (y/n): n
Thanks for using the calculator!
```

## 🛠️ Building Steps

### Step 1: Start Simple
Begin with `simple_calculator.py` - a basic version that does one calculation.

### Step 2: Add Loops
Modify to allow multiple calculations without restarting.

### Step 3: Add Error Handling
Handle division by zero and invalid input.

### Step 4: Polish the Interface
Make it look professional and user-friendly.

## 🏋️ Challenges (Optional)

Once you complete the basic calculator, try these enhancements:

1. **Memory Functions**: Store and recall previous results
2. **Advanced Operations**: Add power, square root, percentage
3. **History**: Show a list of all calculations performed
4. **Scientific Mode**: Add trigonometric functions

## 💡 Key Concepts You'll Practice

- Variables and data types
- User input and type conversion
- Conditional statements (if/elif/else)
- Loops (while loops for continuous operation)
- Functions (organizing code into reusable pieces)
- Error handling (try/except blocks)

## 🎉 What You'll Learn

By completing this project, you'll understand:
- How to structure a complete Python program
- User input validation and error handling
- Creating interactive command-line applications
- Code organization and best practices
